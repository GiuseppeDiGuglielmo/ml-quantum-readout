# ml-quantum-readout
This project uses hls4ml to create the firmware implementation of machine learning algorithms for single and mult-qubit readout.

## Environment 
```bash
$ conda env create
$ conda activate qreadout-env
```

## Train
Run the training script to obtain an optimized checkpoint.
```bash
$ python FcNN_SingleQubit_RawData_tinyModel.py
```
List of saved checkpoints can be found [here](https://fermicloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jcampos_services_fnal_gov/Eneb82SL2s5ItPpzcefppf0B6uPbiELoxlybgFL-i4HU_w?e=og90Lf).
